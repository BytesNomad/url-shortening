# URL shortening Project

This project contains source code and supporting files for the serverless application that you created in the AWS Lambda console. You can update your application at any time by committing and pushing changes to your AWS CodeCommit or GitHub repository.

This project includes the following files and folders:

- src - Code for the application's Lambda function.
- events - Invocation events that you can use to invoke the function.
- \_\_tests__ - Unit tests for the application code.
- template.yml - A SAM template that defines the application's AWS resources.
- buildspec.yml -  A build specification file that tells AWS CodeBuild how to create a deployment package for the function.

Your Lambda application includes two AWS CloudFormation stacks. The first stack creates the pipeline that builds and deploys your application.

The pipeline creates a second stack that contains your application's resources, including Lambda functions, an API Gateway API, and Amazon DynamoDB tables. These resources are defined in the `template.yml` file in this project. You can update the template to add AWS resources through the same deployment process that updates your application code. You can view those resources in the **Resources** section of the application overview in the Lambda console.

For a full list of possible operations, see the [AWS Lambda Applications documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/deploying-lambda-apps.html).

## Try the application out

The sample application creates a RESTful API that takes HTTP requests and invokes Lambda functions. The API has POST and GET methods on the root path to create and list items. It has a GET method that takes an ID path parameter to retrieve items. Each method maps to one of the application's three Lambda functions.

**To use the sample API**

1. Choose your application from the [**Applications page**](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home#/applications) in the Lambda console. (Make sure you're in the right region)
1. Copy the URL that's listed under **API endpoint**.
1. At the command line, use cURL to send POST requests to the application endpoint.

        $ ENDPOINT=<paste-your-endpoint-here>
        $ curl -d '{"id":"1234ABCD", "name":"My item"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST $ENDPOINT
        {"id":"1234ABCD","name":"My item"}
        $ curl -d '{"id":"2234ABCD", "name":"My other item"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST $ENDPOINT
        {"id":"2234ABCD","name":"My other item"}

1. Send a GET request to the endpoint to get a list of items.

        $ curl $ENDPOINT
        [{"id":"1234ABCD","name":"My item"},{"id":"2234ABCD","name":"My other item"}]

1. Send a GET request with the item ID to get a single item.

        $ curl $ENDPOINT/1234ABCD
        {"id":"1234ABCD","name":"My item"}

To view the application's API, functions, and table, use the links in the **Resources** section of the application overview in the Lambda console.


## Build and test locally

The AWS SAM command line interface (CLI) is an extension of the AWS CLI that adds functionality for building and testing Lambda applications. It uses Docker to run your functions in an Amazon Linux environment that matches Lambda. It can also emulate your application's build environment and API.

If you prefer to use an integrated development environment (IDE) to build and test your application, you can use the AWS Toolkit.
The AWS Toolkit is an open-source plugin for popular IDEs that uses the AWS SAM CLI to build and deploy serverless applications on AWS. The AWS Toolkit also adds step-through debugging for Lambda function code.

To get started, see the following:

* [PyCharm](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/toolkit-for-jetbrains/latest/userguide/welcome.html)
* [IntelliJ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/toolkit-for-jetbrains/latest/userguide/welcome.html)
* [VS Code](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/toolkit-for-vscode/latest/userguide/welcome.html)
* [Visual Studio](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/toolkit-for-visual-studio/latest/user-guide/welcome.html)

To use the AWS SAM CLI with this sample, you need the following tools:

* AWS CLI - [Install the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html) and [configure it with your AWS credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html).
* AWS SAM CLI - [Install the AWS SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html).
* Docker - [Install Docker community edition](https://hub.docker.com/search/?type=edition&offering=community).

Build your application with the `sam build` command.

```bash
my-application$ sam build -m package.json
```

The AWS SAM CLI installs dependencies that are defined in `package.json`, creates a deployment package, and saves its contents in the `.aws-sam/build` folder.

Test a single function by invoking it directly with a test event. An event is a JSON document that represents the input that the function receives from the event source. Test events are included in the `events` folder in this project.

Run functions locally and invoke them with the `sam local invoke` command.

```bash
my-application$ sam local invoke putItemFunction --event events/event-post-item.json
my-application$ sam local invoke getAllItemsFunction --event events/event-get-all-items.json
```

The AWS SAM CLI can also emulate your application's API. Use the `sam local start-api` command to run the API locally on port 3000.

```bash
my-application$ sam local start-api
my-application$ curl http://localhost:3000/
```

The AWS SAM CLI reads the application template to determine the API's routes and the functions that they invoke. The `Events` property on each function's definition includes the route and method for each path.

```yaml
      Events:
        Api:
          Type: Api
          Properties:
            Path: /
            Method: GET
```

## Unit tests

Requirements:

* Node.js - [Install Node.js 10](https://nodejs.org/en/), including the npm package management tool.

Tests are defined in the \_\_tests__ folder in this project. Use `npm` to install the [Jest test framework](https://jestjs.io/) and run unit tests.

```bash
my-application$ npm install
my-application$ npm run test
```

Next, you can use the AWS Serverless Application Repository to deploy ready-to-use apps that go beyond Hello World samples and learn how authors developed their applications.
